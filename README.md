The Python script main.py in PyBank was developed as a homework assignment to analyze fictional financial records that contain a date and the profit/loss. The script imports the csv resource file then loops through the list to calculate the number of months represented. The Python script for PyPoll analyses voting ballots to determine the spread of the votes across the candidates and the winner of the election.

The dataset was created by edX Boot Camps LLC, for this educational project only.

I used the Method 3: List Comprehension from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-converting-all-strings-in-list-to-integers/ to structure the profit_loss variable.

The base code to write the file to text was provided by the U-Penn Bootcamp class instructor, Reed Hyde.
